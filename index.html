            <p class="poscaption">This is my first iteration of my poster. For this design, I opted for a simple bilateral typographic system. 
                In addition to this, the poster features a simple monochromatic colour scheme, displaying all of the necessary information effectively. 
                I did not opt for this as my final design due to the fact that it is so basic. As a result of its simplicity, the poster fails to capture 
                the rugged fashion of skate culture that can commonly be seen in other skateboarding posters and magazines.</p>
            <img class="pos" src="images/CARP poster 2.jpg">
            <p class="poscaption">For my second poster, I used an Adobe stock image of a girl skating as a background. The poster features both black 
                and white text to contrast its background. A more simplistic typeface has been utilised in this rather than that of the first poster, as I 
                believed the previous typeface was less legible when used over the stock image that fills the background. Another issue I faced with this 
                poster was the difficulty of fitting all of the necessary information onto the canvas, which I was eventually unsuccessful in doing.</p>

                background. The poster also features a variety of typefaces in an effort to display all of the information in an effective and easily 
                legible manner.</p>

            <p class="reflection">Regarding my 8 typography pieces, I believe I did a sufficient job at representing the variety of typographic structures. 
                Throughout, I consistently maintained a simplistic aesthetic, using the same colour scheme for each piece, also matching the theme of my 
                website. Each typographic system is unique, and they are clearly defined with brief, accompanying descriptions. In addition to this, I also 
                successfully included all of the key information, clearly displaying the structure of each typography between the pieces. Furthermore, I 
                completed all 8 pages within adequate time of the deadline, allowing me to easily implement and display the images on my website. 
                <br>
                <br>
                One improvement that I could have made was in my representation of the random typographic system. Although the text is organised in a way with 
                no pattern or rule, I believe it is possible that I could have made the elements more random. The random typographic system specifies that the 
                text does not have to be easily legible, or legible at all. Therefore, I could have possibly been more creative in my development, using more 
                elements such as text or shapes to represent the system more effectively. Another refinement that could have been made within my typography is 
                my representation of the grid format. Although my depiction vaguely resembles a grid, it may not be clear enough as I prioritised creativity 
                over suitability.</p>
            <p class="reflection">The final iteration of my poster successfully met the criteria of the brief in multiple ways. Firstly, I displayed contrast through the use 
                of a smooth, colourful gradient within the logo and some of the text, juxtaposing the dark and grainy background. Alignment has been achieved through displaying the necessary information to the right, top, and bottom of the poster, creating 
                an even spread of text that avoids overwhelming the viewer. Repetition has been used in the consistency of fonts, sticking to only two for the 
                entire poster. Adding to this, the same colours and shades can be seen throughout the poster, using the same gradient for some of the text, and 
                the same shade of grey for the rest. Finally, proximity can be seen with the abundance of blank space in the background, ensuring that the poster 
                isnâ€™t too cramped with text. On top of this, I have also done well in prioritising a rugged appearance, successfully capturing the general image 
                of the skating community, making the poster well themed to its purpose.
                <br>
                <br>
                Something I believe that could have been improved within my poster is the fonts that are in use. Although I have technically restricted myself to 
                two typefaces, neither of which resemble the typefaces that are present in the logo. This gives the appearance of too many fonts; therefore, I 
                believe I could have found a font family that resembled the logo more closely to improve the consistency of the poster as a whole. </p>
